Squareosity
===========

2D retro neon super awesome physics puzzler: this is just a proof of concept 

Controls
========

Arrow keys = movement

A = respawn (when you see the neon red skull (you've died) there is a glitch at the start of the game, you will start dead)

ESC = Pasue 

gamepad sticks will work even better, use if you have them!



Side-note
=========
There is only one level, so when (if) you complete it you are pushed back to the start of it! Collect the stars! 

And remember
============

Don't tocuh the neon. Only the side walls are safe.
